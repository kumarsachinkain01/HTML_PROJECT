                <h1>Agra womans family didn't cooperates, leid that she had left for B'lulu: CMO</h1>
                <p class="date">11th Sep 2024</p>
                <p>A post is being shared on Facebook with a claim that a woman who returned to Bangalore with her husband from their honeymoon in Italy fled to her parents’ home in Agra after her husband was detected positive for coronavirus. Let’s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.
                    Claim: After husband tested positive for coronavirus, wife fled from Banglore to Agra .

                    Fact: The woman went to her parents place in Agra on 9 March, while her husband was confirmed positive for coronavirus on 12 March. Also, she didn’t enter Bangalore city. Karnataka government has also clarified that the woman didn’t flee to her parents’ place. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.  
                    When searched about the posted information on the internet, an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zdpjxcPu59Os7QTNhXI0_bxgFS5auC9V/view?pli=1" target="_blank"> article </a> published by ‘Times of India’ on 14 March 2020 was found. From the article, it can be read that “According to health officials, the woman, who recently returned from her honeymoon in Italy and Greece and was put under quarantine after her husband showed symptoms of the disease. She escaped from Bengaluru on 08 March, took a flight to New Delhi and travelled to Agra to be with her parents.”

                    However, TOI later <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/covid-19-techies-wife-who-defied-quarantine-flew-to-delhi-took-train-to-reach-agra-tests-positive/articleshow/74618637.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank">updated</a>  the article stating that the women left Bangalore on 09 March before her husband was not tested positive for coronavirus. Her husband was tested positive on 12 March. In the same article, it can be read that the couple travelled to Greece, Switzerland and France but not to Italy as mentioned in the post. So, the woman did not flee from quarantine as she left directly from Bengaluru airport on 09 March before her husband was tested positive.

                    <h2>Heavy rain in Agra causes severe waterlogging, man swept away in flooded drain</h2>
                    <p class="date">11th Sep 2024</p>
                    <p>Agra received heavy rain on Thursday, with 124.4 mm in 24 hours, causing severe waterlogging throughout the city. Amid the incessant rain, 30-year-old Ravi Kumar Mahaur went missing after being swept away in an overflowing drain.

                        Ravi, a resident of the Mantola area, was returning home late at night when he slipped into the flooded Mahavir drain. His wife, Neelam, reported him missing to the police after he didn't return home. Neelam, who was staying with her family at the time, told India Today, “Ravi was on his way back home when the water was so high that he was swept away. We searched all night, but we couldn't find him.”The rain, which began late at night, submerged several parts of Agra and damaged infrastructure. Two classrooms in a century-old girls’ school building collapsed during the night, avoiding potential loss of life since no students or staff were present.</p>
